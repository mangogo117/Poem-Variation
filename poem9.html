		<h6>Sad is the man who is asked for a story<br>and can't come up with one.</h6>
		<p>His five-year-old waits in his lap. <br><em>Not the same story, Baba. A new one.</em></p>
		<h6>The man rubs his chin, scratches his ear.</h6>
		<p>In a room full of books in a world<br>of stories, <span>he can</span> recall<br>not one, and soon, he thinks, the boy<br>will give up on his father.</p>
		<h6>Already the man lives far ahead, he sees<br>the day this boy will go.</h6>
		<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don't go!<br>Hear the alligator story! The angel story once more!<br>You love the spider story. You laugh at the spider.<br>Let me tell it!</em></p>
		<p>But the boy is packing his shirts, he is<br>looking for his keys.</p>
		<h6>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Are you a god,<br>the man screams, that I sit mute before you?<br>Am I a god that I should never disappoint?</em></h6>
		<p>But the boy is here. <em>Please, Baba, a story?</em><br>It is an emotional rather than logical equation,<br>an earthly rather than heavenly one,<br>which posits that a boy's supplications</p>
		<h6>and a father's love add up to silence.</h6>
		<p><br></p>
		<h5>A Story</h5>
