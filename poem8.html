			<li>	<h4>Sad</h4>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is the man who is asked for <strong>a story</strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and can't come up with one.</p>
				<p><br></p></li>
				<li><h4>His five-year-old son</h4>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; waits in his lap.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Not the same <strong>story</strong>, Baba. A new one.</em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The man rubs his chin, scratches his ear.</p>
				<p><br></p></li>
				<li><h4>In a room full of books</h4>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in a world<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of stories, he can recall<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not one, and <strong>soon</strong>, he thinks, the boy<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will <strong>give up</strong> on his father.</p>
				<p><br></p></li>
				<li><h4>Already</h4>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the man lives <strong>far ahead</strong>, he sees<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>the day</strong> this boy <strong>will go</strong>. <em>Don't go!</em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Hear the <strong>alligator story!</strong> The <strong>angel story</strong> once more!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You love the <strong>spider story</strong>. You laugh at the <strong>spider</strong>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let me tell it!</em></p>
				<p><br></p></li>
				<li>	<h4>But the boy</h4>
					<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is <strong>packing</strong> his shirts, he is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>looking</strong> for his keys. <em>Are you a <strong>god</strong>,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the man <strong>screams</strong>, that I sit mute before you?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Am I a <strong>god</strong> that I should never <strong>disappoint</strong>?</em></p>
					<p><br></p></li>
					<li><h4>But the boy</h4>
					<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is <strong>here</strong>.<em> Please, Baba, a story?</em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is an <strong>emotional</strong> rather than <strong>logical</strong> equation,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an <strong>earthly</strong> rather than <strong>heavenly</strong> one,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which posits that a boy's <strong>supplications</strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and a father's <strong>love</strong> add up to <strong>silence</strong>.</p>
