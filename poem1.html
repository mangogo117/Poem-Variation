		<p>a story</p>
		<p>li-young lee</p>
		<p>sad is the man who is asked for a story<br>and can't come up with one.</p>
		<p>his five-year-old son waits in his lap.</p>
		<p>not the same story, baba. a new one.</p>
		<p>the man rubs his chin, scratches his ear.</p>
		<p>in a room full of books in a world<br>of stories, he can recall<br>not one, and soon, he thinks, the boy<br>will give up on his father.</p>
		<p>already the man lives far ahead, he sees<br>the day this boy will go.</p>
		<p>don't go!</p>
		<p>hear the alligator story! the angel story once more!</p>
		<p>you love the spider story. you laugh at the spider.</p>
		<p>let me tell it!</p>
		<p>but the boy is packing his shirts,<br>he is looking for his keys.</p>
		<p>are you a god,<br>the man screams, that i sit mute before you?<br>am i a god that i should never disappoint?</p>
		<p>but the boy is here.</p>
		<p>please, baba, a story?</p>
		<p>it is an emotional rather than logical equation,<br>an earthly rather than heavenly one,<br>which posits that a boy's supplications<br>and a father's love add up to silence.</p>
