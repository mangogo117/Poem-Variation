		<h3>A Story</h3>
		<h5>Li-Young Lee</h5>
		<p><br></p>
		<div>
			<p><strong>Sad</strong> is the man who is asked for a <strong>story</strong><br>and can't come up with one.</p>
		</div>
		<p><br></p>
		<div>
			<p>His <strong>five-year-old son</strong> waits in his lap.<br><em>Not the same story, <strong>Baba</strong>. A <strong>new one</strong></em>.<br>The man rubs his chin, scratches his ear.</p>
		</div>
		<p><br></p>
		<div>
			<p>In a room full of <strong>books</strong> in a world<br>of <strong>stories</strong>, he can recall<br><strong>not one</strong>, and <em>soon</em>, he thinks, <em>the boy<br>will give up on his <strong>father</strong></em>.</p>
		</div>
		<p><br></p>
		<div>
			<p>Already the man lives <strong>far ahead</strong>, he <strong>sees</strong><br>the <strong>day</strong> this boy will <strong>go</strong>. <em>Don't go!</em><br><em>Hear the <strong>alligator story!</strong> The <strong>angel story</strong> once more!<br>You <strong>love</strong> the <strong>spider story</strong>. You <strong>laugh</strong> at the spider.<br>Let me tell it!</em></p>
		</div>
		<p><br></p>
		<div>
			<p>But the boy is <strong>packing</strong> his shirts,<br>he is <strong>looking</strong> for his <strong>keys</strong>. <em>Are you a <strong>god</strong>,<br>the man <strong>screams</strong>, that I sit <strong>mute</strong> before you?<br>Am <strong>I</strong> a god that I should <strong>never disappoint</strong>?</em></p>
		</div>
		<p><br></p>
		<div>
			<p>But the <strong>boy</strong> is <strong>here</strong>. <em>Please, <strong>Baba</strong>, a <strong>story</strong>?</em><br>It is an <strong>emotional</strong> rather than <strong>logical</strong> equation,<br>an <strong>earthly</strong> rather than <strong>heavenly</strong> one,<br>which posits that <strong>a boy's supplications</strong><br> and <strong>a father's love</strong> add up to <strong>silence</strong>.</p>
